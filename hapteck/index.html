					<p>Oh this is easy. GAURDIANS OF THE FREAKING GAlAXY!!! ok. you can go on with your lives...</p>

					<p>Still here? K. Well for starters, there were some other really, REALLY great movies; Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Lego Movie, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, X-Men: Days of Future Past, and last, but most certainly NOT least, How to Train Your Dragon 2 (runner up in my opinion). What Guardians of the Galaxy did was extraordinary. It took us out of this world and told as a story about a spy, a smuggler, a revenge fueled maniac, a tree, and a raccoon. You should all be applauding Marvel's courage right now. What's truly amazing, is that the movie was fantastic. The chemistry between the characters was perfect, comedy was present, character development made sense and felt rewarding, and the world felt real. It's so good I almost want to compare it to Star Wars, but can't. Honestly the only flaw I found with this movie is that the villain wasn't that great. I would compare it to the villain for Thor 2 where he just kinda came in and left by the end of the movie. And the only other thing I would be upset about is that the Nova Core wasn't as prominent as it probably would've been, but that's just my inner nerd talking. Seriously though, this movie attracts a freaking large audience. It's almost scary how many people could enjoy it. It's got a bit of romance, a whole lot of comedy, action, and story to get people wanting a lot more adventures from the now loved Guardians of the Galaxy.</p>
