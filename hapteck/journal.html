					<p><a href="http://awwwards.com">Awwwards.com</a> is an easy to navigate website especially for all the content they have to cover. But sometimes the color scheme confuses certain sections and makes it harder to tell what's what on the site. One thing I would take away and use for myself is the navigation that stays at the top of the window for easy access.</p>
					<p><a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit.com</a> is a great site where you can find massive amounts of information and entertainment. It's use of categories and subreddits is flawless and offers a powerfull filtering system to present content to the user. There is absolutely nothing wrong with reddit.com.</p>
					<p><a href="http://linusmediagroup.com">LinusMediaGroup.com's</a> biggest pro is that it's simple and does a wonderfull job of presenting information. I did find some issue with the difficulty and bugginess of browsing their photos and featured page. I would like to take self-presenting featured pages on the main page and use it for myself</p>

					<p>Fixed the movement script! And I got the camera to move up and down without moving the player. Still can't jump but unity has a lot of built in gravity elements so that should be pretty easy.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="journal">
					<h3 class="article_title">Entry 8 - 4/7/2015</h3>
					<p>Went backwards a little bit. The imported assets didn't work. Working on creating my own movement script with the help of youtueb tutorials. The computer is not liking unity either. Very laggy whenever I start to edit the script.</p>

				<div class="journal">
					<h3 class="article_title">Entry 7 - 4/6/2015</h3>
					<p>Learned to program in C#. slight differences in syntax that give you more control over your program with a lot less typing. Converted player control scrypt in unity to C#. Used built in unity assets to create better physics and movement for my character. Next class I will try and set up multiplayer using a network manager called Photon. It gives you classes and methods to create servers and scripts for your game.</p>

					<p>Strings in JavaScript store characters.</p>
					<p>Variavles are containers that store data values that can be used to represent the data it contains.</p>
					<p>Using spacing in JavaScript is something you need to be careful with. Spaces can be used to allow the code to be read differently or for aesthetic purposes. Forgetting spaces in some places can result in an error. For example: when you declare a variable, a space needs to go between "var" and your variable name. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var variableName = "example";</p>
