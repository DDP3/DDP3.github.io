			<p>Websites are simply a necessity in the modern age. To be without one, even if the site itself is but a hollow, content-less shell, is to be without the distinct evolutionary advantage used to keep one's self afloat. Aha! As such, this very website serves as the thin, terra-cotta colored line between a world of pure reason, and the ever-howling, infinite depths of chaos. So much we ask of this piece of HTML, tempered with CSS.</p>
			<p>But does it not provide?</p>
			<p>That was the "about me" section that I originally wrote in this homepage, back when it was the review project. It represented a less informative but more poetic biographical style, focusing more on the core concept behind the style than the choices I made. I'll try to clear that up. </p>
			<p>Originally, the site was almost entirely brown, and relied on thick, rounded borders to separate areas. It was a teetering, precarious mess, reliant on decimal percentages and margin/padding bargaining to push my messy divs into exactly where I wanted them. It was kind of a mess. The content for the new site essentially created itself according to the project's content requirements, but styling required an innovative challenge.</p>
			<p>I designed it to look minimalist, warm, and calm, like the desert. Getting rid of the borders was necessary to creating this effect. I kept the browns, which hearkened back to tan sands and adobe houses. To separate the different sections, I used different colors while still sticking with the general dulled scheme. The site is designed to be horizontal on a desktop and pleasantly vertical on mobile. Instead of the default bootstrap navigation bar, I opted for simple text on a red background, complete with an indicator of what page you are currently on.</p>
			<p>The challenge was re-learning how to style, without the continual fiddling of pixels and percentages in a css file. Where previously my page was messy behind and pristine in front, it became clean and flexible. Once I started modifying the content to fit the row formats better, it all clicked together. What I learned was that styling is not all done in post-production, but is an effort to be undertaken from the very beginning.</p>

			<p>And yes, these pictures are about me. Carl Linnaeus (left) is my favorite phylogenist, the middle panel is from my favorite comic, Gunshow, and the far right image captures my penchant for old maps.</p>
