      <h4>Tuesday, February 17th, 2015</h4>
      <p>We started learning JavaScript today. Last class we were finishing projects and working on the CodeCademy site. Here are three new things I learned today...</p>
      <p>A string is a value that usually is a word but can be a digit. It is surrounded by quotation marks. There are many different properties.</p>
      <p>A variable is a conditional value that you use in JavaScript to store information and data. </p>
      <p>A number is a digit that is used in JavaScript and it does not have quotation marks around it. You can print whole numbers or decimals.</p>
      <h5>The summary of today:</h5>
      <p>This class period, I finished the review project and I will be progressing to new projects. My grade is an A right now.</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="journalWrapper">
      <h4>Thursday, February 19th, 2015</h4>
      <p>We did a warm up that required knowing a bit about variables in JavaScript.</p>
      <p>I am a little behind.</p>
      <h5>The summary of today:</h5>
      <p>This class period, we heard some new annoucements and worked on Moodle. Just turned in the review project. Almost perfect score.</p>
    </div>
    
    <br>

    <div class="journalWrapper">
      <h4>Monday, February 23rd, 2015</h4>
      <p>The objective for today was to create arrays in JavaScript. I am not at that point yet.</p>
      <p>I will keep doing the JavaScript track on CodeCademy.</p>
      <h5>The summary of today:</h5>
      <p>This class period, I was working a little bit on the review and paper about the History of the web we read about.</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="journalWrapper">
      <h4>Tuesday, February 24th, 2015</h4>
      <p>We talked about arrays today because many people learned about them. I am still doing the track in CodeCademy.</p>
      <p>There are other ways to create arrays then what we learned.</p>
      <h5>The summary of today:</h5>
      <p>This class period, I worked on JavaScript in CodeCademy. We learned a bit about strings and numbers.</p>
    </div>
    
    <br>

    <div class="journalWrapper">
      <h4>Thursday, February 26th, 2015</h4>
      <p>We worked on Moodle today and I almost finished JavaScript on CodeCademy, but I got a little stuck.</p>
      <p>I will try to work on the tutorial at home because I can access it.</p>
      <h5>The summary of today:</h5>
      <p>This class period, I worked a littl bit on Moodle and am ready to move to projects.</p>
    </div>
    
    <br>

    <div class="journalWrapper">
      <h4>Monday, March 2nd, 2015</h4>
      <p>We made a JavaScript cheat sheet today because it was part of the drill. It was glued in our notebook.</p>
      <p>Since it was a Monday and it was only a 45 minute period we didn't really have time to work because the glue in took a while.</p>
      <p>We talked in groups and discussed what JavaScript is about.</p>
      <h5>The summary of today:</h5>
      <p>This class period, even though we didn't have time to work on the computer besides web journal we learned more about JavaScript.</p>
    </div>
    
    <br>

    <div class="journalWrapper">
      <h4>Tuesday, March 3rd, 2015</h4>
      <p>The drill was about ways we can use variables and what this does "var name = prompt("What is your name?)".</p>
      <p>We learned that it would appear in the web page if called upon. </p>
      <h5>The summary of today:</h5>
      <p>This class period, we had a glue in about arrays and learned about removing and adding things to lists with JavaScript.</p>
    </div>
    
    <br>

    <div class="journalWrapper">
      <h4>Thursday, March 5th, 2015</h4>
      <p>We created a for loop and learned about how they worked. Along with while loops.</p>
      <h5>The summary of today:</h5>
      <p>This class period, we made a for loop with groups today. Loops make it easier to print things out because printing to the console 6 times would be a waste because a loop would help. </p>
    </div>
    
    <br>

    <div class="journalWrapper">
      <h4>Monday, March 9th, 2015</h4>
      <p>In this short period we worked on the project assigned, but I was focusing on catching up with Moodle and such.</p>
      <h5>The summary of today: </h5>
      <p>This class period, I learned new things regarding this web journal and how to use your common sense to figure out techniques.</p>
    </div>
    
    <br>

    <div class="journalWrapper">
      <h4>Tuesday, March 10th, 2015</h4>
      <p>In class I pretty much perfected my website.</p>
      <p>The journal is functioning and styled now and I finally fixed the images on the front page. I decided to make it look nicer and cool with a dashed border.</p>
      <p>I still need to do stuff on Moodle, but I am glad I finally finished my website so now I can move on to JavaScript.</p>
      <h5>The summary of today:</h5>
      <p>This class period, I made my last basic changes to my website so that I can move on to JavaScript in Moodle. I will take this project home and work on Moodle for homework because I recently got Sublime Text 2 on my Windows 7 laptop. </p>
    </div>
    
      <br>

    <div class="journalWrapper">
      <h4>Thursday, March 12th, 2015</h4>
      <p>Today in class I finished perfecting my web journal and got all caught up on that aspect of class. </p>
      <p>I plan to come in during tutorial today because we actually have it this week and I need to still catch up.</p>
      <h5>The summary of today:</h5>
      <p>This class period, I learned some new things and completed a couple great things on Moodle.</p>
    </div>
    
      <br>

    <div class="journalWrapper">
      <h4>Monday, March 16th, 2015</h4>
      <p>I am behind still and I try to bring my work home, but sense I feel like I have no deadline it's hard to put that work first. I am a little stuck on the array challenge because I think there is probably an easier way yet I can't find examples of my problem. </p>
      <h5>The summary of today:</h5>
      <p>This class period, we did not have much time to work because it's Monday but I got some little things done.</p>
    </div>
    
    <br>

    <div class="journalWrapper">
      <h4>Tuesday, March 17th, 2015</h4>
      <p>I am stuck on the easy little array project because I don't know what's going on. I don't exactly know how to ask for help because it's such an easy thing.</p>
      <h5>The summary of today:</h5>
      <p>This class period, we had a sub and I worked on the array project and almost fell asleep. This array project doesn't make sense to me.</p>
    </div>
    
      <br>

    <div class="journalWrapper">
      <h4>Thursday, March 19th, 2015</h4>
      <p>I figured out the array challenge today and moved on to all the different videos I had left to watch.</p>
      <p>I'm glad that I am updating my journal everyday and on top of it.</p>
      <h5>The summary of today:</h5>
      <p>This class period, a lot of people worked on their projects and finishing them up, but I am catching up STILL so I haven't started it. Sense I won't have a lot of homework over spring break maybe I will work on it.</p>
    </div>
    
      <br>

    <div class="journalWrapper">
      <h4>Monday, March 30th, 2015</h4>
      <p>Today is a short day, because it's Monday and I will try to get a hold of my project that I should have started over Spring Break but I didn't because who even does homework over spring break??? </p>
      <p>I will not have time to really start the project but I will look at it and work on it tonight.</p>
      <h5>The summary of today:</h5>
      <p>This class period, I started working on the project today and I will take it home and work on it more. I'm tired of being behind but it's not easy to just whip out a project like this.</p>
    </div>
    
      <br>

    <div class="journalWrapper">
      <h4>Tuesday, March 31st, 2015</h4>
      <p>Today in class we had two groups and I was in group 2 working on projects because I'm still not done. I can't wait to get caught up and move on to new things.</p>
      <p>I am almost done with the formatting (css) on my project then I will have to work on the JavaScript. Since I don't have English homework it might be easier to work on this project at home.</p>
      <h5>The summary of today:</h5>
      <p>This class period, I learned about covering the button with the hover color. I also figured out how to move and adjust a picture around a page.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="journalWrapper">
      <h4>Thursday, April 2nd, 2015</h4>

      <h4>Monday, April 6th, 2015</h4>

      <p>I will push myself to email Jamieson for help on the project if I need it today, I will go home and finish my project and make it really perfect.</p>
      <h5>The summary of today:</h5>
      <p>This class period, it was silly and short because Monday and I got some work done. I feel very overwhelmed but I get to go to French class next.</p>

      <h4>Tuesday, April 14th, 2015</h4>
      <p>We did stuff as a class today and worked with Bootstrap.</p>
      <p>The sites we visited were interesting they include... <a href="http://species-in-pieces.com/">Species-in-Pieces</a>, <a href="http://www.berengereaudo.fr/">Berengere Audo</a>, and <a href="http://chrisniedenthal.com/en">463 Photographs.</a> I enjoyed all the cool movement in the first site and it's ability to resize in the window was awesome. I didn't like that there wasn't a lot of interactive things, seemed like a boring site. The second site stood out to me because I didn't know what it was about, but it was cool because when you moved the mouse it drew some cool pictures. The third website contained lots of photos which were fun to look at and see different topic. That site didn't have anything wrong with it in my opinion.</a></p>
      <h5>The summary of today:</h5>
      <p>This class period, I learned a lot of new things and we explored some sites that were interesting.</p>

      <p></p>
      <h5>The summary of today:</h5>
      <p>This class period, I learned a bit more about Bootstrap and realized it's way above my level of coding. I hope to become better at understanding. I might read up this weekend on the website.</p>

      <p>We have about a week left of school in this class (2 weeks overall) and I'm stuck on the project. Maybe when Jamieson comes back from Baltimore on Monday I can ask some questions on how to get started with this final project.</p>
      <p>If I can... I will probably come in to class after school and work on my project.</p>
