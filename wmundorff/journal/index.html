				<p>A string is used in javascript for text (such as words and sentences). Strings are stored in variables. </p>
				<p>A variable is used to store data values in javascript. They manipulate and change things by using 'if..then' statements.</p>
				<p>A number is used in javascript for making calculations. You can add and subtract in javascript just like you can in real life.</p>
				<p>In summary, numbers and strings are stored and manipulated through variables. The spacing between things doesn't matter, as long as everything is there.</p>

				<p>Today, I learned how to input information asked through javascript onto my html page. Thursday, I hope to make it so a button appears on my page and I can click it to ask the food questions again. JavaScript is interesting and I enjoy working with it even though it is more difficult than anything else we've done.</p>

				<p>Do not go gentle into that good night
					Dylan Thomas, 1914 - 1953
					Do not go gentle into that good night,
					Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
					Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

					Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
					Because their words had forked no lightning they
					Do not go gentle into that good night.

					Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
					Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
					Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

					Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
					And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
					Do not go gentle into that good night.

					Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
					Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
					Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

					And you, my father, there on the sad height,
					Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
					Do not go gentle into that good night.
					Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

				<p>Mr. Jameison showed us how to integrate bootstrap into our code to style our webpages cleanly. While a little confusing at first, it makes a lot of sense and I get it.</p>

				<p>Last class, we looked at various websites to glean information about them for our own use. I went onto <a href="http://kurokawawonderland.jp/">Kurokawa Wonderland</a>, <a href="http://www.eurosport.fr/">Eurosport</a>, and <a href="http://wordscansave.me/">Words Can Save Me</a>. For Kurokawa Wonderland, the design was very nice but the puspose of the site as a whole was very unclear. I had no idea what I was doing on the site. Eurosport was nicely designed and easy to navigate, but was in another language that was not translated well with google translate. Words Can Save was also nice looking and clear, but slow to load at times. </p>

				<p>Everything is put into one folder and my journal is bootstrapped. All I need to do now is set up my navigation bar, style my different prjects a little bit, and link everything. I am confident I can finish by next week, as long as I keep working hard at it.</p>

				<p>There are only four more days of school and I just need to upload my project to gitbhub. While it may not be as good as it could have been, I am proud of what I have accomplished considering my time in this class has been very limited in the past few weeks. Hoepfully I will be all done on Monday.</p>
