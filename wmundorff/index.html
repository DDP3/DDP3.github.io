Some I learned in September, and some I didn't learn until a few weeks ago. There are four main parts to this project: The home page (this page), my rock, paper, scissors, game, my journal, and my form (a survey of sorts). I chose to design my site in different styles because of everything I learned this year, there was a lot of variation. The different layouts reflect all the diverse things I have come to understand in this class. The thing I am the most proud of on this project is my r/p/s/ game, because I believe it looks the cleanest out of all my components. From the color scheme to the javascript, it is the project I believe I made the best. I am also proud of the navigation bar, simply because the navigation bar is always so frustrating to get correctly. Thank you Mr. Jameison for teaching me how to do all of this, as well as provide help whenever I needed it. I hope to continue coding in some form when I enter college in the fall.</p>
