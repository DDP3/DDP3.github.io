			<p>2/23/15</p>
			<p>Today I worked on my website after being thrown behind for so long after the field trip. I'm starting to wonder if the field trip was actually worth it. I plan on catching up when I have the time during late arrival and tutorial.</p>
			<h3>Vocab: </h3>
			<p>String-- Used for words and sentences.</p>
			<p>Variables-- Containers for storing data values. Cannot start with a number, seperate with an underscore or camelback.</p>
			<p>Numbers-- Used for calculations, lack quotes</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>2/24/15</p>
			<p>Haha! I have finally finished my website and sent it to Mr. Jamieson. Today I learned about arrays and proceeded to investigate them in a new website.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>3/05/15</p>
			<p>I took a quiz about arrays and learned about the different data types.</p>
		</div>


		<div id="entries">
			<p>3/02/15</p>
			<p>Today I made a JavaScript cheat sheet! I plan on using it whenever I'm stuck and about to lose my head.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>3/5/15</p>
			<p>I learned all about loops today. They are used in order to save time by making less lines of code and to eliminate redundancies.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>3/10/2015</p>
			<p>This class I got a pretty good start on my comprehensive JavaScript project.  I plan on making it into a quick game that can be played amongst two players.
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>3/16/15</p>
			<p>I continued to work on my website. Added a background and some stylized text boxes.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>3/19/15</p>
			<p>Today I figured out how to make a button that would change the background color of the responses.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>3/30/15</p>
			<p>Back from spring break! Today I made a few more buttons. Next class I'm going to link my two pages together and turn in my project once and for all!!.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>3/31/15</p>
			<p>WHOO-HOOOOOO!! I finished my JavaScript project and submitted it via google docs. I'm feeling good about it!</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>4/2/15</p>
			<p> I survived April Fool's day without getting pranked once! Yes!
			Also, today I showed Mr. Jamieson my JavaScript project and started working on the new Rock Paper Scissors project. Progress, yeah!
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>4/6/15</p>
			<p> Watched some screen casts explaining how to do things I was stuck on. I also continued to work on my project.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>4/7/15</p>
			<p>Today I worked on the looks of my rock paper scissors game.  I'm adding a nice Japanese touch to it. </p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>4/9/15</p>
			<p> I continued my game programming and troubleshooted the problem I had with linking the JavaScript to the Html pages.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>4/14/15</p>
			<p>I did some website adventuring, visited websites that won awards.</p>
			<p>Here are the websites I visited:</p>
			<h2><a href="http://kurokawawonderland.jp/">Kuro Kawa Wonderland</a></h2>
			<p>This website had a spectacular-looking intro video, lots of info, and the starry background looked pretty neat. The downside the the intro video was that it was a little long, however there was a time controller feature so you could skip parts, rewind, or rewatch whatever scenes stike your fancy.</p>
			<h2><a href="https://www.cadenceandcause.com/">Cadence and Cause</a></h2>
			<p>The page layout was laced with graphics and was easy to navigate. The organization behond the site was pretty awesome as well-- Buying music in order to raise money for charity! However the main page was a little cluttered and busy.</p>
			<h2><a href="http://timeshift165.com/">Time Shift 165</a></h2>
			<p>Out of all the websites I saw today, this one has to be my favorite. It centers around a car-- It has a racing minigame, mystical music, and the site is overall pleasingly simple. The only drawback I can find with this site is the long loading screen.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>4/16/15</p>
			<p>I updated my web journal today. Yay.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>4/21/15</p>
			<p>I completed my bootstrapping practice. Im ready to combine it with my rock paper scissors project!</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>4/28/15</p>
			<p>Took the ACT test and now my brain is fried. Been staring at the screen and contemplating life's greatest mysteries.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>4/30/15</p>
			<p>Attempted to continue trying to make the results div change it's picture based on the user results. Having a difficult time...</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>5/4/15</p>
			<p>May the fourth be with you...</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>5/5/15</p>
			<p>Feliz Cinco de Mayo! Today I asked Mr. Jamieson for help on my Rock Paper Scissors project about why some divs worked when you clicked on them and some didn't. Fortunately we figured it out! Now I'm working on bootstrapping my project and eventually upload it to GitHub.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>5/11/15</p>
			<p>I continued my Bootstrapping adventure today. I  went in during 1st period and got help from Graham Heppworth, the man who knows a good rye when he sees one.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>5/12/15</p>
			<p>Bootstrapping complete! It is time to work on my final project! PS I also learned how to make forms! YAAAY!</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>5/18/15</p>
			<p>Happy Monday, people. (note the sarcastic undertone.) After going on vacation for four days, my brain is not functioning for work. Nevertheless, I started my final project!</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>5/19/15</p>
			<p>Made lots of progress today linking all my webpages together for my final. I also learned what a "DOM" is. It stands for Document Object Model, which is a family tree-like chart used in coding.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>5/26/15</p>
			<p>Been trying to troubleshoot the forms I put on my main page. In addition to that, I added a new page to display my projects from video production. After today I will focus on getting the required stuff done before working on anything extra for my website.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>6/1/15</p>
			<p>Happy June~</p>
			<p>I asked Mr. Jamieson to troubleshoot my forms. He succeeded. After that I learned how to make a radio-style form, in which you click on bubbles to fill in a desired answer.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>6/2/15</p>
			<p>I perfected my forms, changing the names of the variables to make sense with their functions. I also wrote comments in my javaScript code. Tomorrow I will work on bootsrapping everything.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>6/4/15</p>
			<p>Wow, only three days left of coding... It's crunch time, baby! Today I began bootstrapping my website and worked on re-styling my navigation bar. Now the navigation scales down when using a mobile device.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entries">
			<p>6/9/15</p>
			<p>I have finished. Farewell, codding class~</p>
