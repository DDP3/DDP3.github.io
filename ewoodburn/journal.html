			<p> Variables in JavaScript are containers that store data values. A string can be stored within a variable and it contains and manipulates text. Numbers can also be stored within a variable and they contain and manipulate numbers. Basically, it is very easy to make mistakes in JavaScript because there are several syntax errors such as not having a necessary space or using the wrong quotation marks. JavaScript is a whole new language where you must grasp the basics first.</p>

			<p> I'm working on the RPS project and it's goin alright. Griffin helped me with some mistakes, but I figured out most of the stuff on my own. It's pretty helpful to see the other guy's game, so I can fully understand what each element does.</p>

		<div class="journalWrapper" class="row">
			<h4> Tuesday, Apr. 7th, 2015 </h4>

			<p><a href="http://paprika.com/">Paprika:</a> This website is for a Canadian graphic design and marketing firm. Their website features a very clean layout with predominantly black and white elements. I liked the cool effects when you scroll and the introduction to the site. It has a kind of weird loading bar at the bottom that takes away from the cleanliness of the page.</p>
			<p><a href="http://giacomorelli.com">Giacomorelli:</a> A company that prodcues high-end shoes. I like that the text has a strikethrough when you hover, but I'm sure that isn't very appealling to older people. It has a very bold design and again, has a black and white theme goin on. The movement is kinda weird on the site though, and made the user experience a bit harder.</p>
			<p><a href="http://melanie-f.com/en/">Melanie F:</a> This website features a children's shoe line. Definitely more appealing towards women, based on the color scheme and the cute background. I liked the movement within the scroll and the floating images in the background. However, the site may be a little too simplistic for a retail website. Unless you were familiar with the brand, the person buying the shoes would have a hard time understanding how to purchase a shoe or what any of the sizes meant.</p>

			<h4> Monday, Apr. 20th, 2015 </h4>

			<p> My site is fully functional in with Bootstrap! I'm going to maybe make an overall results section?? Maybe?? I'm not really sure how to, but I'll ask Griffin!</p>

		<div class="journalWrapper" class="row">
			<h4> Thursday, Apr. 30th, 2015 </h4>

			<p> I'm getting started on my final project! Today I started bootstrapping my web journal. I'm not really sure what to do with it though. I think I'll add some more color and be good. </p>

		<div class="journalWrapper" class="row">
			<h4> Thursday, May 7th, 2015 </h4>

			<p> So I'm working on my review project and I'm high-key strugglin. I've got all my pages and forms and stuff, but everything just looks really bad. I'm also brainstorming things to add to my form. </p>

		<div class="journalWrapper" class="row">
			<h4> Tuesday, May 12th, 2015 </h4>

			<p> I'M GOING TO MAKE MADLIBS AND IT'S THR BEST IDEA I'VE EVER HAD IN THIS GODFORESAKEN CLASS</p>
		</div>

		<div class="journalWrapper" class="row">
			<h4> Monday, May 18th, 2015 </h4>

			<p> So I'm pretty much done! I have all the "required" elements for the final project, but I guess I could add some stuff to get a better grade.</p>
			<p>Things I could do:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Add some stuff to my form to make it funnier</li>
				<li>Style the pictures on the homescreen, something looks weird about them</li>
				<li>Maybe take away the border on my web journal entries??? IDK</li>
				<li>OH I really need to have a thumbs up/down button for the results in the RPS game</li>
				<li>Comments in the code (bleh)</li>
				<li>Console.log stuff in my js, but honestly, I don't even really know how to do that</li>
			</ol>
			</p>

		<div class="journalWrapper" class="row">
			<h4> Monday, May 18th, 2015 </h4>

			<p>So I made a better nav bar, but there are some poopy parts of it. I styled the home screen pics and added a thumbs up thingy for RPS. I still need to comment my js and finish up my navbar. Then I'll get creative and do something.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="journalWrapper" class="row">
			<h4> Thursday, May 28th, 2015 </h4>

			<p>Mr. Jamieson is gone, so I'm a little lost on my nav bar. But I got started on commenting my javascript files. Unfortunately, I have to leave early so I didn't really get anything done. Lo siento.</p>
		</div>

		<hr>

		<div class="journalWrapper" class="row">
			<h4> Monday, June 1st, 2015 </h4>

			<p>I got everything done that's required! All I need to do now is upload to GitHub! I might try to fix my nav bar, but it also seems way too complicated, so I think I'm all done.</p>
