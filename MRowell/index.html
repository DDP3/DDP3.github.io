        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>I have lived in portland all my life.  I am a fourht generation Franklin High School student, my great grandmother beging one of the very first graduating classes.  And although my family has lived in portland most of thier lives, I am breaking the tradition, and goign to Atlanta for school the next fall.  I am very excited to be going to thier business school in the next few years as well.  I have loved business for as long as I can remember, and I am excited to emerse myself in it more than I have been  int the past.  Please note as you are reading this, the text runs off the screen and I can only see about half of what I am writing,  I am not sure if I have deleted important informaiton, or if I possibly but unlikley have it all right.  I have also palyed tennis for as long as I can remember.  I have played for the varsity tennis team the last four years, and I went to state with my doubles partner last year, but not this year. </p>

        <h2>What I am supposed to write</h2>
        <p>  I thought we were supposed to write an actual bio, but this is what I am supposed to write.  This site began with the sites of all my other websites.  I tried to make each navigation bar slightly diffrent just to have fun with it.  I then started on the home screen which I am most proud of.  I learned how to make a permanent background image, a carosel and drop down menu.  I am very pleased with how it all turned out.   </p>
