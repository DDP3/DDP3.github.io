			<p>Today we discussed what we need from Mr Jamieson in this class for the rest of the year. For the most part everyone needs work time, and some clarification on the final, and its components. Today I created a navigation bar, which works, but does not look the greatest. Still it is an improvement over not having any navigation bar at all. I started looking at forms a little bit, and the different components and how they work. Mr Jamieson also explained to me how we will be putting everything together for our final project.</p>

			<p>Today I am going to try to add a nicer looking navigation bar to my final project. What I currently have in more of a place holder than anything else. One problem I am having is that the spacing and indentation in the html for my web journal is different than for my other two pages. I do not know what happened, and I have not been able to fix it manually.</p>

I know how to use github, and my folder now shows up for everyone else, and not just me. I was doing everything correctly, except for the final step of syncing to github.</p>

				<p>Today I created a nice looking navigation bar, using bootstraps default navigation bar. There are still a few things which I need to change about my nagivation bar, but for now it is okay, and it is a lot better than what I had before. I also worked on my websites home page, and have added more of a biography, and one picture of a koala. I still need to create a form for my website, I will start that next week.</p>
