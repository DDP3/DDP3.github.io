          <p class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">Patrick Benjamin was born in Portland, Oregon on December 16th, 1996. He lived the first 2 years of his life just outside Portland city limits in Hillsboro, before moving to his current residency in Northeast Portland. He spent his early days enjoying the outdoors, playing sports, or building beautiful creations out of Legos.</p>
          <p class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">In 2002, Patrick first walked through the doors of Glencoe Elementary School. Patrick enjoyed his time there, and made many friends that would last a lifetime. During his time at Glencoe Elementary, Patrick was also a member of the Mt. Tabor Soccer Club, and spent many Saturdays kicking away on various fields across Portland. After Glencoe, Patrick moved on to Mt. Tabor Middle School, and met many new challenges and opportunities, as well as many new friends. </p>
          <p class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">After 9 years at these various institutions, Patrick moved on to his current place of learning, Franklin High School. Here Patrick experienced much growth and learning, and became the man he is today. Thanks to this quality education, Patrick is prepared for whatever the future holds for him. </p>
