				<h4>Here are today's main ideas:</h4>

				<p>Today we started JavaScript. Spacing is important in JavaScript mainly to keep it organized and easy to read, like any other code, but occasionally it makes a difference, like needing a space after a var tag.</p>

				<p>A variable is a little box that is used to store information, such as letters or numbers. (similar to Scratch variables)</p>

				<p>Strings are words or text inside either double or single quotes. A string must end with whatever quote type it started with. So if a sting starts with a double quote, it must end with a double quote. If both types of quotes are used in a string, you can put a \ before that quote.</p>

				<p>Numbers are used for calculations, keeping track of scores, or anything that is being counted in a variable.</p>

				<h4>The summary of today:</h4>

				<p>This class period, I finished the following things: Created the JavaScript Intro webpage, the Rainbow background webpage, and my Web Journal. I need to check my review project for mistakes using a code checker. Right now my grade is a C because of mistakes in my review project. </p>

				<p>Finalize work on JavaScript projects</p>

				<h4>The summary of today:</h4>

				<p>I finished the JavaScript project, and continued to try to make the background change with a button, but I couldn't figure it out. I also fixed the problem with my picture not appearing when I clicked the button that makes it appear. For some reason it wasn't able to find it in the local place, so I had to have it look for it in the global place by putting "window." before the function name. Jason did that.</p>

				<h4>Here are today's ideas:</h4>

				<p>Analyze various web design featues. Create a simple site using a bootstrap grid.</p>

				<h4>The summary of today:</h4>

				<p>I looked at <a href="http://www.species-in-pieces.com/#">species-in-pieces.com</a>, <a href="http://designertrek.com/">designertrek.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.electricbodies.com/">electricbodies.com</a>. Species in pieces was an interactive description of 30 different endangered species. They made representations of the animals using the same set of triangles, just shifting the parameters to change the shape. That would be a cool thing to play around with for animations. Designer trek was an advertisement website for a retreat for coders that involved indoor and outdoor activites. I liked how they organized the text and pictures to fill the entire page, but also be minimalistic. They also had some cool things where the pictures transitioned directly into the background, and I would like to know how to do that. Electric bodies was a site selling t-shirts with guitars on them, but the website was so minimalist that it was hard to tell what it was for, making you explore and sucking you in. The transitions on electric bodies were very smooth and were slightly delayed, which is something I would like to add to my websites.</p>
