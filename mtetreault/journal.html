              <p>    A variable is something in javascript that creates a box in which you can put stuff into. It needs a string is something inside of a variable that contains text, sentences, and alerts.
             number is also something that goes inside a variable and it can be used for computations such as adding, subtracting, and keeping track of the score in a game.
              Summary: Today I completed the moodle checklist and learned about javascript. Next class I will continue to learn and work with javascript. I also created a new page for my website that will host all of my journal entries (including this one) that will talk about what I have done in class and what I will do in the next class. I believe right now I have an A in this class. No other information is relevant at this time.</p><hr>

              <p>Today I finished styling my journal entry page. I used developer tools and the help of Mr. Jamieson to find and fix the problem. I also changed the site text in order to make the journal entries more readable. I checked out the new forum and learned about javascript through this interactive medium. Next class I will learn more about coding with javascript and making my site more interactice.</p><hr>

              <p> Today I leanred how arrays work and how to use them in js. I worked on the arrays challenge and I am almost completed with it. I also watched the two screen casts on moodle which are what taught me about arrays.</p>

          <p>Today I learned how to put the things that the user answers in javascript into the html page. After they answer the questions their answers appear as a sentence on the web page. I learned how to do this with the help of other students and W3 schools. Next class I will work in the next challenge.</p><hr>

          <p>Today I watched a moodle video and took a quiz about javascript related topics. I also watched an introduction video on for loops and will continue to work and play with these loops next period.</p><br><hr>

          <p>Today we worked on a javascript cheat sheet that helped explain and clarify different parts of the code in javasript. It was helpful and informative and will enable me to more efficiently code in the future.</p><br><hr>

          <p>Today we did a worksheet and learned about how to manipulate arrays. I also gleaned a basic understanding of forever loops and how they work. A very confusing subject but I look forward to learning more about it.</p><br>

          <p>Today I did a loop challenge and gained a better understanding of how forever loops and while loops work. Next class we will be getting a javascript project and I will use my knowledge learned today to do this.</p><br>

          <p>Today I wrote the code for the forever and while loops on my project website. I also coded a button that makes a picture pop up when it is clicked. I accomplished a lot today and look forward to continuing this trend of success.</p><br>

          <p>Today I finished all of the coding and centering things for my javascript project. I also changed my color scheme a bit after Mr. Jamieson made some aloof comments about its quality. Still not sure if he likes it he just says "Tetreault....." so I am not sure what that means.</p>

          <p>Today I submitted my project through google drive to Mr. Jamieson. I organized the files correctly and I hope to get an A on this assignment. Everything was completed and I feel very confident in my work. It was not the hardest project but it did challenge me and forced me to focus my attention.</p>

          <p>I began trying to apply bootstrap to my rock paper scissors website game. I read about it and explored the bootstrap website to begin to understand the grid system. It does not totally make sense yet but I am sure it will soon.</p>

          <p>Today I explored websites that won awards for their css. I looked at a few interesting ones, taowisdom.com was very neat because the images were stunning and beattiful and I liked the set up. Kingsman was also neat because it relied heavily on user interaction as it was based becoming a "kingsman" like in the feature film. Finally I looked at the grantland website which used a simple yet effective grid system to style everything and this site responded admirably to mobile size. All in all I learned a lot about how to make an effective website. Example: <a href= "http://grantland.com">Grantland</a></p>

          <p>Today I took some surveys and created a github account. I almost got to throw some paper at Mr. Jamieson but then he finished talking before his time ran out so that was frusturating. Now it is time to work more in my site and boostrapping it.</p><hr>

          <p>Today was my first day in class for about a week. I missed all of last week in this class becuase I was at districts for tennis. Unfortunately I did not make it to state but the year was still fun and I enjoyed my last season. I had not done much coding for a while and so today I went on moodle and looked at the rubric for the final project. I added a home page and finsihed styling the navigation bar for my site. Everything is linked and I also began adding to the home page everything that is required. It was a short period so I didn't have a lot of time but I accomplished a good amount and I will continue to add to it to finishe my project.</p><hr>

          <p>I finished styling my home page today and started to comment the javascript code. It has been a while since I worked with javascript and so I had to read through all of the code to begin with to refresh in my mind what exactly all of the code does. I got part of the way through but it will take much longer than I realized because there is so much code and I need comments for almost all of the lines. Today is also William's birthday, he finally turned 18 years old so that is exciting! I played tennis with Mr. Jamieson yesterday verus Mathew and William and we won so that was fun!</p><hr>

          <p>My first time in this class in a week. Monday we had no school and tuesday I was gone at the AP English Senior beach retreat where we cleaned up the beach and read poetry around a fire. In class today I commented the rest of my javascript code and put the finishing touches on the rest of my project. Next class period I will go through the rubrik and my project again to make sure that I have all of the necessary details and then I will submit my project to GitHub and that will about wrap up my year in Digital Design and Computer Coding.</p><hr>
