            <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 col-md-4" id="biography">I designed this site and all of its content through lots of hard work and practice. When I began this year I had never looked at computer code before and was entirely out of my comfort zone. It took me a while to even grasp the basics of html and css. I struggled and watched as my friends were able to easily master these techniques. Once we started doing javascript things began to click for me. Everything began to make sense and the coding turned into more of a fun activity rather than an assinged drudgery. I am most proud of the form page which I figured out how to do with very little help and same with the Rock Paper Scissors. I understand how the code works for each of them and that is what I am proud of. Have fun poking around my sight! I chose these pictures for my home page becuase I love tennis, I love space, and I will be attending University of Puget Sound for college. These three things are very important to me and so I used these pictures to represent important aspects of my life.
