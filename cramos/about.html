					<h1>About hapteck.com</h1>
					<p>Hapteck.com was launched in February of 2015 as a blog site to share and talk about whatever the heck I wanted to share or talk about. I do all of the html and site work myself in order to bring about the style that I want for the site. And partly because I'm a control freak about little things.</p>
					<p>On this site I usually write about movies I see, news I here, and things I'm working on. I will also post to the blog about whatever question people ask me through the site's email. I think community is important and am working vigurously on implementing more community friendly tools for the site.</p>
					<p>I don't have any real hopes for hapteck other than interacting with as many people as possible on topics we both enjoy. That's what I truly love about online communities. Just being able to find a place to fit in so easily in an environment that's full of welcoming users.</p>
					<p>If you have any questions, news topics, or other things you want to share to me feel free to email: hapteckentertainment@gmail.com</p>
