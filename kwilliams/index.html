      So. Who am I? Well first of all my name is Katherine Williams and I'm in Mr.Jamieson's 3rd period DD&CC class. This class is pretty interesting in my opinion. I've learned a lot of things that I probably would never have leaned anywhere else. I wouldn't particularily say that I am good at the stuff I do in this class, but I would say that I enjoy learning about the stuff we've been learning in this class.
      I'm currently in my senior year, and as it is really stressful, at the same time it isn't. Currently I am taking 4 AP classes (actually 3 at the moment because AP Government is only a half year kinda thing), but I am only taking 3 of them seriously. My study habits could be better but I would say that because I work so often, I have less time to even try studying. I've got bills to pay!

      I currently work as a lifeguard and swim instructor at a nearby community center. It is an... interesting job. I don't hate it, but I don't like it as well. Maybe it's just the people that I work with that I don't really like... but ANYWAYS, it is a job that gives me a feeling of responsibility because I have to ensure the safety of the patrons and my students as well. On the picture on the side is of me and my friends. Yeah, I know. We're super cool. Totally. Next year I will be attending Portland State University and I'm not too sure as to what I will be studying quite yet. Possibly business or something computer related.

    <p class = "col-xs-12 col-sm-4 col-md-4"> Set It Off is a band that I have listened to since probably the beginning of my senior year. Originally, I had heard of them from a story I had been reading called "Kill The Lights", which happened to be the title of one of their songs. I looked them up and really liked the music that they produced. Unfortunately, by the time I became a fan of these guys, they were just about to hold a show in Portland... So I was unable to get tickets at such a short notice.</p>
    <p class = "col-xs-12 col-sm-4 col-md-4"> On March 11th, 2015 they had a show held in Portland at some theater place and I was able to go to that one. It was pretty amazing. I learned a lot of things from that experience and now I know that at a show if someone says to "make a circle", you need to run to the side, or you will be pushed. I totally got to touch Cody Carson's hand and it was the best day ever. The end. </p>

  <div class = "row">
    <p class = "col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12"> As of recently, one of the band members has been kicked out of the band for reasons that I will not explain. It was pretty disappointing, but it was all for the best, and the band did a good job at keeping the loyalty and safety of their fans. By the responsible courses of action they have taken, I have decided to continue to support these guys, even through the tough times. </p>
