			<p> Because today was a short class period, we discussed what would help us to be successful in this class and made a helpful "JavaScript cheatsheet". For what would help me do better in this class, I just wrote down time; we are given a rather short amount of time to do certain challenges and some of them are more difficult than others and need more time for me to complete. For the "cheat sheet" we made, it just gave examples of different things that can be used in JavaScript, along with the definitions of what they do. It was very helpful and a good use of class time. </p>

			<p> The first website, "Frank Collective", was very interesting and although it was rather informal, it was in a way that worked and simplified things. The navigation bar for this website was really nice: the whole front page of the site was the navigation bar, so the words were written really large, and when the mouse is hovered over it, the words move to the side a little, and there is a description of what information would be given on that page. What I didn't like that much about the site was that there wasn't much decoration to the page - it was very simple. Other then that, the site was really nice and interesting. </p>

			<p> On the second site, "Aero Lab", it gave an almost complex feeling to it that was pretty cool. As for the navigation bar, whenever one of the things was hovered over, the whole background of the website would change color - I really liked that aspect to it. Something I disliked was how boring the rest of the site was. It wasn't that bad, it's just that there was so much information listed on the site, it was something I just skimmed over briefly. </p>

			<p> The last site that I looked at, "Qubik", was written mostly in a different language, but that didn't take away any of the niceness of the page. There were many things that I liked about this page. For example, the navigation bar was neatly placed on the left side of the site, staying in the same spot while I scrolled down. That makes it so I don't have to scroll all the way up to get to the navigation bar. Another thing I liked was that the background of the website was not the same throughout the entire website. There would be different colors and pictures as I scrolled along the site. The last thing I really liked about the site was that it connected people to social media websites like Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr. That is something I would probably want to put in a site in the future. There wasn't much that I disliked about this site. </p>

			<p> Today we finished working on our grid practice thing for bootstrap. Last class I was very confused as to how it worked, after a little experimenting and tring different things, I was able to do it correctly for the most part. Now that I kind of get how the grid thing works, there are probably a lot more things I can learn to improve the design of my websites. I look forward to learning more! </p>

SOMEHOW I ACTUALLY FINISHED IT! WOO! It took a really long time, but it is now done! Now that I'm done with applying bootstrap to my journal, I should probably try to make it look better... There is something wrong with this day's journal entry, but I'm not quite sure as to what that problem is... Nvm. Fixed it. </p>

I worked on sprucing up my sites, since I already made a site that consisted of at least a home page, my rock, paper, scissors game, and my web journal. I'd say that for the most part, things are looking pretty good. I should probably style my site to make it look better, but I feel like that would require a lot of work and I'm not really sure as to what else I can do to make it look better. </p>
