                       <h3>Tuesday, February 17 2015</h3>

                            <p>A string is strings returned from String calls in a non-constructor context (i.e., without using the new keyword) are primitive strings. JavaScript automatically converts primitives to String objects, so that it's possible to use String object methods for primitive strings.</p>

                            <p>A variable is used to hold values (like price2). You can also use variables in expressions (total = price1 + price2).</p>

                            <p>So today we watched a lot of screen casts and just followed what Mr. Jamieson was saying, mainly copying what was on his screen, I created a Journal page on my website but need to style the entries to look nicer. I hope I can learn a lot more about JavaScript and am able to use it to my advantage. Along with all of that we watched a video to learn about Variables, Strings, and Numbers. I understand them but not all that well.</p>

                            <p> var (message); is the right thing to enter in to JavaScript</p>

                            <p>Today I basically worked on JavaScript and added another journal entry on my website which looks very swell. Even though I feel as if we should only do entries online in place of actual notebook entries (mainly to save the earth!!!!).</p>

                            <h3>Tuesday, February 24 2015</h3>

                             <p>Today I learned how to set up alerts and ask questions back to the user, my website is now user-friendly, after the person enters their answer it replies back with exactly what they said, crazy huh?!</p>

                            <p>Today we completed the "cheat sheet", which in short showed what certain parts of code did in sublime. It was all JavaScript based and mainly focussed on array's and variable and a little info on length.</p>

                            <hr>

                            <h3>Monday March 09, 2015</h3>

                            <p>Today I started working on the new JavaScript project, I'm starting with the content, then styling and learning how to use buttons through w3 schools, from there I will go to styling the page trying to find the best color combo. Then the most important part is the JavaScript so I'll do that. I also am renovating my main website, I want had a whole new look and try to dazzle some people. It looks pretty good so far.</p>

                            <p>Today I started the Project 1 officially, I am done wih the home page now I am working on the JavaScript I will most likely be done in a day or two I just need a little more time to figure some stuff out considering I am not the best with JavaScript.</p>

                            <p>Today I created a coverpage for my Main Website, I incorporated a full screen image of downtown Portland into the background and a button that fades in when hovered over. I need to work on getting better at JavaScript. </p>

                            <h3>Thursday, March 27, 2015</h3>

                            <p>Today I worked on a for and while loop project, even though I suck at JavaScript, I want to focus more on bootstrap and css. To me JavaScript is very confusing and I dont think I will ever incorporate these pop-up boxes into my website</p>
