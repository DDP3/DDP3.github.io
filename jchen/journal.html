						<h3>Tuesday, February 17th 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's main ideas:</h5>
						<p>We started to move onto learning JavaSript. At first, we started to examine the potential of JavaScript in website creation. Then we took notes of properties of JavaScript and how to have correct syntax. More specifically we learned that:</p>
						<ul class="row">
							<li class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4"><p>A string is a series of characters that are inside quotes. These characters can be anything. If your string has quotation marks in it, you must either use the other alternative; &quot; or &apos; or have a backslash added before the mark.</p></li>
							<li class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4"><p>A number is just a number. It will be used for keeping count of something and for calculations. It is one fo the values that can be put into variables.</p></li>
							<li class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4"><p>A variable is used to store values to be sued through the code. Two types of values that can be stored are numbers and strings.</p></li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<h5>Summary of today:</h5>
						<p>This class period I finished the rainbow demonstration project as well as began this journal. what I hope to accomplish next class period is to actually use JavaScript in creating content. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Thursday, February 19th 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main ideas:</h5>
						<p>Mess around with JavaScript and post and answer questions on a forum.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>This class period I answer a few questions on the forum and practiced using JavaScript. So far my grade's all good and there's nothing much to do. Next class I hope there's a bit more to do. </p>
					</div>
										
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Monday, February 23rd 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main ideas:</h5>
						<p>Learn how to use and create JavaScript Arrays.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>Today I created and used arrays in order to have an interactive websties using arrays and prompts. In addition, I answered some questions on the JavaScript forum involving numbers and strings. Next class, tomorrow, I will just be ahead of everyone unless there's a massive assignment. </p>
					</div>					

					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Tuesday, February 24th 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main ideas:</h5>
						<p>Work more on arrays and JavaScript syntax.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>What I did today was try to make a bunch of prompts appear which causes a user to try to answer it. the prompt is about their favorite foods. Once they answered all these prompts, then you can click a button to have the entire list of the foods. Originally, I had it all in once sentence until I realised that it had to be in a HTML list using the &lt;li&gt; tag. So, that only took a for loop, a large contencated string, and the inner.HTML dot notation in JavaScript. So far my grade's all good, still 100% but it may lower when another quiz is graded.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Thursday, February 26th 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main ideas:</h5>
						<p>Reviewed arrays and all we have learned from JavaScript by taking a quiz. Learned for loops and incorporated that into a web. A for loop can be denoted with the following code:</p>
						<br>
						<p>for(var i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {console.log(i);}</p>
						<br>
						<p>which would print out the numbers 0 to 3 in the console. If we're done, learn while and if loops.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>I already know all about for, while, and if loops so I didn't spend much time on it. In fact, I used for and if loops in one of the previous challenges already. Instead, what I did was finish up the objects section on codecademy and review syntax for everything. I haven't really used while do loops for a while. But I still know the basics. My grade's already pretty good, but I would like to create a new way to automatically make these time-consuming journal entries. Maybe create a form with all the necesary things and save them in JS so that they can be added with a click of a button.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily" id="March">
						<h3>Monday, March 2nd 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Write out what each method, function, and various syntax on JavaScript on a cheat sheet. It involved variables, arrays, Math methods, properties, and values.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>We covered syntax on JavaScript. It was a tool that we could use for projects later on when we're confused on what to do or what to write in JavaScript. So far my grades all good, nothing much has changed. I still would like to create a new, easier, automated way of creating these things. I guess I'll just go research it right after I finish this entry.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Tuesday, March 3rd 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Go through some more methods involving arrays.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>We went over the methods of shift();, unshift();, pop();, and push();. They are used to create interactive arrays for stuff like inventory, users online, and wait requests. We did not know a lot of what these are actually used for, but it's a good idea to know them. In addition, I researched more on the easy, streamline creation of these entries. As you can see above, there is already a way to save and bring up plain text files. I can be used to see and review what file there are. It was taken from a blog called This Could Be Better.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Thursday, March 5th 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Went through a loop based challenge of creating prompts to set down names of cats and dogs.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Tday:</h5>
						<p>We created a simple loop based challenge with for and while loops. It is a very simple based challenge of where we use a loop to create a prompt that asks for names of cats and dogs an put thems, one by one, in the document. Because of this, there was no time to refine the automated way of adding stuff to this web journal. So far my grades all good, no changes from last entry/class. Hopefully I could get this webpage based, non-HTML entries added.</p>
					</div>					

					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Monday, March 9th 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Begin a JavaScript project.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>I began the JavaScript project to create an interactive website. I have an idea of having a &apos;tower&apos; full of minigames and such based on JavaScript. The first floor is going to be something text based in which you clear out a room. the second floor may just be like a &apos;battle&apos; or something like that. The third floor may just be under construction just to have a bit more content on the floors.</p>
					</div>					
					
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Tuesday, March 10th 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Work on JavaScript Project.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>I worked on the project, I mostly worked on that JavaSciprt files. The main problem I have is that the eventlist doesn't really take in functions with input (at least I think so). Therefore I have a lot of repetition on the files. I could probably finish it up tomorrow.</p>
					</div>					

					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Thursday, March 12th 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Work more on JavaScript Projects.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>I kept working on the project. Adding text for each area now at the moment. Grade is still fine right now, not much has changed.</p>
					</div>					

					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Monday, March 16th 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Work even more on JavaScript Projects.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>I worked on the project. I started to add a descriptive, changing text for interactive objects in a room. At the moment, it doesn't do much but it works. I will have the player make potions in a cauldron and touch broomsticks to create witch dust.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Tuesday, March 17th 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Finalize ideas on JavaScript projects</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>Unfortuately, I could not finish the project. I may take it home to work on it a bit more. I really bit off more than I could chew, maybe I shoulda just made something a bit more smaller and not as complex just to have it done. I might work on this a bit at home, but I could just put it down and do whip up something real quick just to turn in.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Thursday, March 19th 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Work and finish up the JS project</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>I finished up and added some pictures to the game, It is now ready for presentation and is currently shared with the teacher. Hopefully I didn't miss anything significant.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Monday, March 30th 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Begin learning conditionals and functions. Then learn about bootstrap.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>That's literally all I did, watch the screencasts and learn about bootstrap. I kinda wish I spent more time on the journal entries, but it's a skinny monday and I can't do much.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Tuesday, March 31st 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Finish up any javascript projects and work on a rock paper scissors project.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>I helped out a few friends in order for them to finish up their javascript. they were really behind so I just spent a lot of my own time, since I was already a bit ahead, to make them work on their projects. Then I worked / started to work on my rock, paper, scissors project. I really hope that  I could work on the aforementioned easy access to wrtiing these things.</p>
					</div>				

					<div class="content daily" id="April">
						<h3>Thursday, April 2nd 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Work even more on rock, paper, scissors projects. We've also went over a bit on functions, if loops, and some built in functions of Math.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>This is the last day of JavaScript projects. Thankfully I've already finished mine. In addition we need to sign up for pcc dual credit now if we haven't already. I'm pretty much done with the rock, paper, scissors project, just a few more touches left.</p>
					</div>					

					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Monday, April 6th 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas</h5>
						<p>Work yet even more on the Rock Paper Scissors project. We got a couple screencasts to explain what to do. We also should be using/learning bootstrap</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>Not much happening today, I just worked on the rock paper scissors project. I've finished the output log, and it is also completely functioning and playable. All I would like to do is make the background change colour when you have a high streak as well as a couple statistics on when you won, lost, or tied. I would also like to replace some text with images as well.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Tuesday, April 7th 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Work on projects, update these web journals, and explore bootstrap.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>I finished up the rock paper scissors project and took a dip in using bootstrap. It's slightly confusing at first, but it contains really useful tools for site formatting and creation. The whole grid aspect of it can easily make things a bit more uniform instead of dealing with thousands of pixels. The only main concern I have it that the grid is not the most customizeable, bootstrap is mostly mde for scaling of devices. But I would like to see even bigger options of columns, for even larger screens. However, it still stays as a really good tool for making mobile friendly websites.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Thursday, April 9th 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Incorporate bootstrap in your projects to have a responsive site.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>I added a bit more content and treid to help out some people around me. For future reference I would like to use one of bootstrap's templates mostly because it's tough for me to find a starting point when making a site. I would also like to see how Less would work in bootstrap. Next class I may just redo the entire Rock, Paper, Scissors project in a bootstrap format just to have something more pleasing to the eye. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Monday, April 13th 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Familiarize yourself with bootstrap and work a bit more on projects. Responsive sites need to be understood using bootstrap.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>I just worked on adding a bit more bootstrap and adding it in my rock, paper, scissors site. Again, I would like to add stuff like acheivements but that's mostly on the backburner (like to quick way of adding entries. I may actually need php for this most likely but I'll see what a bit of Jquery could do).</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Tuesday, April 14th 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Analyze some modern websites and incorporate the use of a grid system in a website. See if you can't use some features out of the analyzed websites. Three websites were analysized from the award winners in cssawards or awwwards.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>What I did was create a simple website around using grids and, again, analyzed some websites for their features. Most of the sites I examined were about creative stuff like drawings, art, other websites, and videos created by a company or a person. A couple bit of stuff I would like to incorporate in my projects are a gallery, maybe some paralax scrolling, and something to return to the top of the page (that one should be easy to create, just create a link the #idofcontainer). In addition, below is a list of all of the sites analysized:</p>
						<ol class="row">
							<li class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4"><a href="http://preto.com.br">Preto</a><p>This is a website that presents creative content by a group called "Preto" based in Brazil. They present videos, illustrations, and drawings. It is mostly full of images presented to the user.</p></li>
							<li class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4"><a href="http://paladininc.com">Paladin Inc.</a><p>A company that lets people find jobs or begin to hire others. It doesn't have the most modern design, but it still has a lot of interesting concepts.</p></li>
							<li class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4"><a href="http://jefersonwinter.com">Jeferson Winter's Site</a><p>Just a web-designer/artist's portfolio. It has a simple, user-friendly design and is mostly displaying this person's talents in a simple, portfolio style format.</p></li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Thursday, April 16th 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Brush up the journal entries. Work on the Grid Practice site using Bootstrap grids. Then work on projects.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>I brushed up the journal entry of yesterday just to a have a bit more information. I also researched into PHP and did a bit more JavaScript prectice/learning from codecademy. I really should just finish up that course really quickly as well as the python course. I wish I could just do a bit more in the programming career. As for my grade, Mr. Jamieson check did a journal check so that was interesting. There wasn't anything significantly wrong with this as there was no comment. Again, I would really wish I could work on that automatic entry kit, but thinking ahead in it, I may need PHP for it.</p>
					</div>					

					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Monday, April 20th 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Make every site we use a responsive one and slightly more modernized. Also attempt to use GitHub (when it is actually installed on all the computers).</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>I tried to add some more modernized styling to the main site where all of the jounral entries are. Again, I would love to add some PHP for this but I may not have the administrative priviliges to do so. At the momoent, I am trying to get a navbar to the site. I may want to use a pre-created navbar made by bootstrap and change it's colour sceme to fit mine. It should be fairly easy to do so; the HTML is already created for me. All I need to do is some copy-pasting and some quick editing next class tomorrow. </p>
					</div>					

					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Tuesday, April 21st 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Continue on adding bootstrap to create responsive websites on our sites. In addition, set up our GitHub accounts. </p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>I sent some info about my github account and we were able to access your master repository.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Monday, April 27th 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Commit my Rock, Paper, Scissors project to GitHub and then work on it, committing any changes to GitHub</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>I spent a long time researching and messing around with GitHub. It was slightly difficult to understand bits of it since we're not going one stpe at a time. Then I polished up some HTML and CSS of the site. </p>
					</div>

					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Tuesday, April 28th 2015</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Create a new URL for hosting our site.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>Because of the fact that we already did that by messing with GitHub yesterday, we didn't really have much to do. So, what I did was research and read the documentary on PHP and then practicing with JavaScript on codecademy. There were also a lot of people not here because they were testing so today was really a break day. </p>
					</div>
										
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Thursday, April 30th</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Work hard and learn something</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>That is exactly what I did. Mostly I messed around with uploading stuff to GitHub as it is hard to do so on a Mac. I may just switch to a PC just because everyone's not sharing the same computer constantly or ask if I could create my own account on that Mac. In addition, I tried to add some styling and responsiveness to my site and Journal, but I am having trouble creating a modern-looking navbar with stuff already created on my site. I could create on from scratch, but I fear that it may not look proper enough for what we're doing. But the Navs that Bootstrap provides doesn't fit the style from my site. In addition, the final was introduced today. It is to upload everything to </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily" id="May">
						<h3>Monday, May 4th</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Upload some more files to GitHub</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>I tried to upload some files, but I keep getting the same few problems. Since it was a short period, I didn't really do anything else today.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Tuesday, May 5th</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Work on FInal projects and upload Grid Practice to GitHub</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>The same few problems happened to GitHub, so I decided to just not work on it and instead keep working on improving my Rock, Paper, Scissors sites and web journal. I have a slight feeling that a part of the problem is the fact that I created a new branch? But I have very little idea.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Thursday, May 7th</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Organize their folders in GitHub</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>I pretty much did what I did yesterday. But as usual, I couldn't actually do anything because I couldn't commit anything in the first place. I may try to delete every file manually, but there is still going to be the problem of not being able to push anything into the repository. I also worked a bit on polishing up everything and creating local files for the final. I may also switch to windows because there's always the problem of people using macs being unreliable to keep your files. Everyon keeps using the same computer which is not very helpful or productive.</p>
					</div>				

					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Monday, May 11th</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>I don't know</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>I was at AP testing for biology. I wasn't here to do anything as it was in the morning. Aparently we got a rubric for the final project. All it listed was that we need to link the rock, paper, scissors game, the web journal, and a page with our information. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Tuesday, May 12th</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Create forms using HTML and JavaScript.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>We created and worked with forms in HTML. We had to include this in our final project. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Thursday, May 14th</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Work hard on final project.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>I started to create the basic design for the final project. So far all I got is a simple navbar, a bio area with a picture in it, and a few filler pictures below that. I am also working on the form that would go right below it. I was thinking of a character dcreation sort of feel and add some lore at the end of it. Next up is to properly style everything and finish the form.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Monday, May 18th</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Continue to merge pages and organize files into a final project.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>I am not going to worry about the files for the final just yet. Not only that, the links to everywhere are already slightly done. Today I continued to work on the form and add some more content in there. All I've added was the class of your character and begun a scret data input as well. It looks fairly good as it is, but I still need a bit more personal styling to make everything better.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Tuesday, May 19th</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Keep working on final project. Then, watch a few videos on the HTML DOM (Document Object Model) and do a quiz about the DOM</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>I kept working on the final project. So far what I've done is mostly try to figure out how to make it more responsive and more mobile friendly. I couldn't really figure out anything for a large part of class. I ultimately decided on just getting a simple resize of the inputs and maybe have some helpful tips show up. There was a lot of trouble with the radio buttons and making that more responsive.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Thursday, May 21th</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Ensure that there are two types of forms in the final project.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>I've continued on adding to the form. I haven't really done any extra styling yet but I have made the form slightly more responsive but no massive redesign on it. I've also started on the JavaScript on it but things are going a bit slow. What I've got right now is just the role of the character (the form is a character creation sheet).</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="content daily">
						<h3>Tuesday, May 26th</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Get a calendar (and work)</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>We got a calendar oh what we got left to do for the rest of the year. It is a simple calendar.
						<br>
						In other news, I finally finished the form and adjusted the output log to be to the right of the form when big screen, or below form when mobile screen. I've also been getting every file in the right folder too, but that's taking a bit of time and lots of repetitive stuff. There's also problems with linking everything together too. Next up is to finish up the files, then style the pages, and then I'm done!

						<h3>Thursday, May 28th</h3>
						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Work on final project and try to finish it up.</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>I worked on fixing up and standardizing the styling for the sites. There was a lot of deciding which colour sceme I should use. In addition, I have a few images of the new look for the jounral (even though you can probably see it right here and right now).</p><br>

						<h5>Today's Main Ideas:</h5>
						<p>Keep working on final project</p>
						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>What I've did today is to keep on smoothing out the kinks of the form spacing as well as colour eveything. So far it's an orange color for the homepage, a purple color for the web jounral, and a green color for the rock, paper, scissors game. The purple may be a bit too extravagant, but it seems fine for now. also, I forgot to post the mobile version of the web journal (and I also had some color added) so here it is.</p><br>

						<h5>Summary of Today:</h5>
						<p>I've finished up the bio and talked about the process of the journal, homepage, and the game. All that is left are the pictures will I could make after school. The bio went over what the process is of the pages of the site. It also went in depth with struggles and what went well.</p>
