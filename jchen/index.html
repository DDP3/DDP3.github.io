					<h4>Biography:</h4>
					<p>This site was designed with the mind of both simplicity and my personal creativity. I always perferred a simple image and many labels added to pictures or descriptions. In addition, the body of the site is a simple, minimalistic white background while the header has a different shade for each part of the site to establish identity of that part of the site.</p><br>
					<p>At first, the site was a very simple short bio, a basic nav-bar, and three images in a container that wasn't even centered. After I've gone into bootstrap, the site became more mobile-friendly and have a more orderly design. In addition, the navbar is much more responsive and, in general, better. Finally, the pictures are much more responsive and have basic descriptions on them. The pictures are definitely the better part of the site. The form however is not the most well positioned, it was mostly due to the wierd nature of how bootstrap labels work.</p><br>
					<p>As for the journal, there wasn't a huge amount of changes. At first, I wanted to have a way to change or make entries without directly changing the HTML code. I found a tool that uses tables and text input to be able to create and save .txt files to a location. I thought that maybe I could make a program to read and save these entries to the jounral. But it turned out that JavaScript + JQuery was not enough, I had to learn and use PHP. So I scrapped that idea; I didn't have enough time to learn PHP throughly enough to use it with all the projects going on. Later on, I wanted an easier way to navigate through the jounral entries. So I stole some of the code from bootstrap's site to create a simple sidebar that navigates through the page using id's. Then the borders for all of the entires were taken out and replaced with more aparent spacing to separate all of the entries.</p><br>
					<p>For the rock, paper, scissors game, it initially started out as something that would display wins, losses, and ties. There would be a large block that displays your choice and the computers choice. Then there are three buttons right below the block for each three choices. After the basic framework was done, I added in winstreaks and highest winstreak. I also added an output log to display at which round was there a win, loss, or tie. After there was a call to make things more modern, I took out the borders, made the buttons be vertical, have the output log to the side of the buttons (expection on small screen sizes), and have the statistics be more responsive.</p><br>
