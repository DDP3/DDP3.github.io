		<h4>Have some JavaScript definitions. Or a cookie. I'd choose the cookie.</h4>

		<p>A string is term or list of terms that are used for storing and manipulating text.</p>

		<p>A variable is like a box that can store information.</p>

		<p>Numbers in JavaScript are only used for calculations. They can also be used in the name of declared variables, but they must NOT be the first character in the name, otherwise you get a big 'ol Syntax Error when you load the page.</p>

		<h4>Here's a cool summary thing.</h4>

		<p>Today, I finished all of today's Moodle checklist. I need to continue learning JavaScript. My current grade is "A".</p>

		<h3>Thursday, February 19th, 2015</h3>

		<h4>Summary for the day is in this box right here</h4>

		<p>Today we went over annnouncements and there is figuratively nothing new on the Moodle checklist so I did nothing. I don't have a question to ask in the forum, and therefore I did not ask one. I also managed to make an image enlarge and shrink in the JavaScripts.</p>

	</div>

	<hr>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Monday, February 23rd, 2015</h3>

		<h4>Yeah a summary again. Bro.</h4>

		<p>TIL about JavaScript arrays. I did the arrays challenge successfully. It was too easy. But I couldn't figure out how to get them to show on the page for the 'extra challenge'.</p>

	</div>

	<hr>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Tuesday, February 24th, 2015</h3>

		<h4>SUMMARY GOES HERE.</h4>

		<p>I worked on my JavaScript skills today. Like working on the one thing where you make an array and it appears all over your screen where you look at it and there is text stuff. Oh yeah I got the aray to go on the screen. And then I made it only appear when you push a button.</p>

	</div>

	<hr>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Thursday, February 26th, 2015</h3>

		<h4>Summarize</h4>

		<p>"For" loops are pretty interesting. I think it's cool how the use of addition of strings can construct lists like the ones we made. I look forward to continued JavaScript stuff.</p>

	</div>

		<h3>Monday, March 2nd, 2015</h3>

		<h4>The Summation of Today's Events</h4>

		<p>Today I created a sheet to help me cheat at JavaScript. I am failing to understand the reason for this, as cheating is heavily discouraged in school. Please, explain your self, Mr. Jamieson. Why oh why did we create a cheat sheet? I an trying to maintain a decent level of academic integrity and you're making it difficult with this. The keyword in cheat sheet is "cheat".</p>

	</div>

	<hr>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Tuesday, March 3rd, 2015</h3>

		<h4>some things today in cODING</h4>

		<p>I successfully creationed a "while" loop. They are moderately interesting, although I curently cannot understand what they may be used for. But it did help to teach me the ways of the logician.</p>

	</div>

	<hr>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Thursday, March 5th, 2015</h3>

		<h4>loopy summary</h4>

		<p>Loops are too simple! Let's learn how to make super complicated games five days into learning JavaScript! That sounds like a great idea, right?! Nah but really loops are interesting.</p>

	</div>

	<hr>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Monday, March 9th, 2015</h3>

		<h4>Sum</h4>

		<p>I got the minimal JavaScript part of the new project finished up. I still need to throw a button in there, but the loops are good to go.</p>

	</div>

	<hr>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Tuesday, March 10th, 2015</h3>

		<h4>CLICK TO SEE THE SUMMARY</h4>

		<p>I got the JavaScript page pretty much done. I have an operating button that displays an image, as well as all of my CSS and HTML. JavaScript is fun!</p>
			
	</div>

	<hr>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Monday, March 16th, 2015</h3>

		<h4>Summary</h4>

		<p>Admittedly, I didn't do very much today. I was very unproductive! Which is okay, I guess.</p>
			
	</div>

	<hr>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Tuesday, March 17th, 2015</h3>

		<h4>Summarie</h4>

		<p>Again, didn't do a whole lot. I thought about doing things, but ultimately didn't end up doing things. I just sat and thought about the Calculus test I had the following period.</p>
			
	</div>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Monday, March 30th, 2015</h3>

		<h4>SUmmaaAtion</h4>

		<p>I learnt about Bootstrap today. Yeah.</p>
			
	</div>

	<hr>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Tuesday, March 31st, 2015</h3>

		<h4>Summmmmmmmmmmary</h4>

		<p>I made some if else then statements and stuff. I put some Bootstrap styling on the page and stuff. Too.</p>
			
	</div>

	<hr>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Thursday, April 2nd, 2015</h3>

		<h4>Sum</h4>

		<p>I got all of the JavaScript done for the Rock, Paper, Scissors game that we are making in class.</p>
			
	</div>

	<hr>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Monday, April 6th, 2015</h3>

		<h4>SummAry</h4>

		<p>I polished up the Rock, Paper, Scissors game so that it felt more functional while also looking better.</p>
			
	</div>

	<hr>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Tuesday, April 7th, 2015</h3>

		<h4>Summary</h4>

		<p>I began work on the Bootstrap page, but struggled in that I could not get my button to call a function. I'll work on it more Thursday</p>
			
	</div>

	<hr>


	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Thursday, April 9th, 2015</h3>

		<h4>Summmmmmmmmmmmmmary</h4>

		<p>I realized that my problem was that I was linking my javascript with "href" and not "src". I wasted pretty much an hour and a half on that because of a rookie mistake. Other than that though, the buttons work great now!</p>
			
	</div>

	<hr>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Tuesday, April 14th, 2015</h3>

		<h4>Sumry</h4>

		<p>I took a look at three websites I thought were interesting. There was a website about Tolkien's "The Hobbit" that I liked a lot. I also looked at YouTube's front page and noticed the top menu bar stayed at the top of the screen even when you scrolled down. I like that element and intend to utilize it in one of my future projects. We also did the grid practice, which I started and completed before class was over. It was interesting and helpful learning for Bootstrap. Hopefully I can use what I learned later.</p>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Thursday, April 16th, 2015</h3>

		<h4>SUMARIE</h4>

		<p>Completely overhauled Rock, Paper, Scissors game using Bootstrap. I'm having a little bit of trouble centering text exactly over my image, but it scales down by screen size and still looks pretty good. All I need to to is properly center the text over the images. The struggle is currently real, but I ancticipate that it will not longer be real on Monday when I blast this said struggle into oblivion with my extreme coding skills.</p>
			
	</div>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Monday, April 20th, 2015</h3>

		<h4>summary</h4>

		<p>This was like 3 weeks ago and I'm updating my journal a little late. I was probably working on the Rock Paper Scissors game. I was trying to get the text centered over the image and failing.</p>
			
	</div>

	<hr>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Tuesday, April 21st, 2015</h3>

		<h4>summary</h4>

		<p>I realized that my problem with the rock paper scissors game was the containers. I had a normal container for my text and a fluid container for the images under it. I changed the normal container to a fluid one and the text and images were finally in line.</p>
			
	</div>

	<hr>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Thursday, April 23rd, 2015</h3>

		<h4>summary</h4>

		<p>I began to upload the thing to the Github and at the end of class it wasn't properly displaying the website.</p>
			
	</div>

	<hr>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Monday, April 27th, 2015</h3>

		<h4>Summary</h4>

		<p>Today I managed to get my Github website to work and in full function. I can now play rock paper scissors on my mobile device using a page I made using JavaScript and Bootstrap.</p>
			
	</div>

	<hr>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Tuesday, April 28th, 2015</h3>

		<h4>Summary</h4>

		<p>I did some stuff today. I moved my Github site over to the ddp3 group versus my own profile. It's now fully functional over at < <a href="http://ddp3.github.io/osbornq/index.html">this page right here.</a> I'm happy with how it turned out. I probably could have selected a different background, though.</p>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Thursday, April 30th, 2015</h3>

		<h4>Summary</h4>

		<p>Today, "teacher" decreed that it would be a free day. No one had to code, although some chose to. I didn't, though. I decided to watch Seth Rogen's "This is the End." It was entertaining for the time I got to watch.</p>
			
	</div>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Monday, May 4th, 2015</h3>

		<h4>May the fourth be with you</h4>

		<p>Today is Star Wars day. Why aren't we watching Star Wars? We should be watching Star Wars. Anyways, I got caught up on my web journals today and took a look at forms. I'm too busy stressing out about AP Calculus BC to be productive in coding class.</p>
			
	</div>

	<hr>

	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Tuesday, May 5th, 2015</h3>

		<h4>summar</h4>

		<p>I had an AP test today and arrived to class an hour late as a result. I ultimately decided not to do any work because I am very exhausted from it.</p>
			
	</div>

	<hr>
	
	<div class="dailyBox">
		<h3>Tuesday, May 12th, 2015</h3>

		<h4>soomary</h4>

		<p>I began to work on another Github page involving forms. I'm not sure how to get JavaScript to detect the checked boxes and post the information. I tried making functions within functions but it ultimately did not work. I will try again on Thursday, assuming I'm not dead from my AP test tomorrow.</p>
